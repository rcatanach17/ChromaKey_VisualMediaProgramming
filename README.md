Chroma-Key is a feature that enables users to remove specific color from an image or video, allowing the removed portion of the clip to be replaced with a different visual. Chroma key utilizes the use of a green or blue screen, chroma green or blue paint to get this effect.

This code utilizes the chroma-key algorithm to enable the user to alter the background of any video or image. The main purpose of chroma-key is that we need to discover a mask that which distinguishes pixels of foreground and background. Then the pixels that correlate with the background will be replaced by the same position pixels of the new background wishing to replace the old one. 
The background that can be altered can be either a still image or a moving image.
